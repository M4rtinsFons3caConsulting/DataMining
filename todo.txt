Structured TODO:

Algorithms to attempt:
- K-Medoids, (with Hierachical Clustering seeds). (use Jesus F., Neves C. Data Analysis slides as reference)
- DBSCAN
- SOM
- LCA (find reference)
- RFM

Step 0 - Apply suggested changes to original:

Apply the suggested changes to the original report (BE BRIEF!), and make note of the new findings regarding promotions.

Step 1 - :

Before we do any of this we should immediately exclude the groups that we have detected as homogeneous, as this will assist our clustering performance. This includes, "one-time shoppers", "whales" of various kinds, and odd segments like the over "60 year old's".

TODO: review EDA in search of such small islands, and schedule them for removal. Crucially they must eventually be compared against any profiles that we end up reaching.

Based on Chapter 13 of "The book",

Step 2:

The distribution of cumulative total amount spent, as shown in the Lorenz Curve, informs us that there is a pressing need to understand if clusters are viable at all levels of expenditure.

TODO: Start with RFM analysis to bucket customers into one of nine buckets ranging from 111 to 333; add this feature to the customers, profile. Then perform clustering.

Step 3:

Preprocess the data, putting outliers aside. To this end, use both unidimensional as well as multidimensional methods.



GEOGRAPHY
PROFILING VARIABLES: REGION, CITY, 
CLUSTERING VARIABLES: CUISINE AMOUNTS, 

This perspective seeks to answer the question how do cuisine preferences vary between 


ORDER PERSPECTIVE
PROFILING VARIABLES: PROMO, PAYMETHOD 
CLUSTERING VARIABLES: N ORDER, N_PRODUCT, AVG_AMT_PER, CUISINES 

This perspective seeks to answer the question how does customer behavior vary as a function of cuisine.

TIME
PROFILING VARIABLES: REGION, CITY, 
CLUSTERING VARIABLES: HOUR, DOW,
