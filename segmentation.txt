Perspective 1: Temporal and Engagement-Based Clustering
Objective: Group customers based on ordering patterns and engagement over time.

    Feature Engineering:
        Recency: current_day - last_order (how recently the customer placed an order).
        Frequency: Total number of orders derived from sum(DOW_0 to DOW_6).
        Time of Activity: Calculate the weighted average of order hours using HR_0 to HR_23.
        Order Spread: last_order - first_order (active duration in the dataset).

    Clustering Approach:
        Use features: Recency, Frequency, Time of Activity, Order Spread.
        Normalize the features (min-max or standard scaling).
        Apply clustering algorithms like K-Means or DBSCAN.

    Profiling Clusters:
        Use categorical features like customer_region, last_promo, and payment_method to interpret clusters.
        Profile by cuisine spending patterns (CUI_* columns) to understand customer preferences.

Perspective 2: Spending and Order Diversity Clustering
Objective: Group customers based on spending habits and order variety.

    Feature Engineering:
        Total Spending: Sum across all CUI_* columns.
        Cuisine Diversity: Count the number of CUI_* columns with non-zero values.
        Vendor Diversity: Use vendor_count.
        Product Engagement: Use product_count.

    Clustering Approach:
        Use features: Total Spending, Cuisine Diversity, Vendor Diversity, Product Engagement.
        Standardize the features to balance the scales.
        Employ clustering algorithms like K-Means or Gaussian Mixture Models.

    Profiling Clusters:
        Use categorical features and day/hour patterns (DOW_* and HR_*) for profiling.
        Understand demographic characteristics through customer_region and explore promotional usage via last_promo.

Comparison of Perspectives:

    Temporal & Engagement-Based Clustering focuses on activity patterns, providing insights into customer recency, frequency, and engagement times.
    Spending & Order Diversity Clustering highlights financial and variety-based behaviors, segmenting customers based on spending capacity and order preferences.

Both approaches can complement each other, offering a comprehensive understanding of customer segmentation.

Here are additional clustering perspectives, each focusing on distinct aspects of customer behavior:
Perspective 3: Cuisine Preferences Clustering
Objective: Group customers based on their cuisine spending patterns.

    Feature Engineering:
        Cuisine Spending Ratios: Normalize the spending in CUI_* columns by dividing each by Total Spending (sum of all CUI_* columns).
        Dominant Cuisine Index: Identify the cuisine with the highest spending for each customer.

    Clustering Approach:
        Use the normalized CUI_* columns as features.
        Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can reduce dimensionality if many cuisines are represented.
        Apply clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering).

    Profiling Clusters:
        Use is_chain to see if preferences lean toward chain restaurants.
        Analyze day and time patterns (DOW_*, HR_*) for cuisine consumption habits.
        Profile regions (customer_region) to identify localized cuisine preferences.

Perspective 4: Time-of-Day and Day-of-Week Ordering Patterns
Objective: Cluster customers based on when they order most frequently.

    Feature Engineering:
        Day Concentration: Calculate the percentage of orders placed on weekdays vs. weekends using DOW_0 to DOW_6.
        Hour Concentration: Identify peak ordering hours using HR_0 to HR_23.
        Order Regularity: Calculate variance or entropy of orders across DOW_* and HR_*.

    Clustering Approach:
        Use Day Concentration, Hour Concentration, and Order Regularity.
        Standardize features and apply clustering.
        Consider time-series clustering methods if temporal sequences are important.

    Profiling Clusters:
        Use payment_method to understand payment preferences during different times.
        Profile by is_chain and customer_region for regional or chain-specific time trends.

Perspective 5: Longevity and Growth Potential Clustering
Objective: Segment customers based on their lifecycle and potential growth.

    Feature Engineering:
        Customer Age in System: current_day - first_order.
        Order Frequency Growth Rate: Slope of a linear regression of DOW_* totals over time.
        Loyalty Metric: Ratio of Frequency to Order Spread.

    Clustering Approach:
        Use Customer Age in System, Order Frequency Growth Rate, and Loyalty Metric.
        Normalize and apply clustering.
        Consider using DBSCAN to identify outliers like rapidly declining or highly growing customers.

    Profiling Clusters:
        Profile by last_promo to identify promotions driving growth or stagnation.
        Examine customer_region to spot regional growth differences.

Perspective 6: Spending Behavior Over Time
Objective: Segment customers based on how their spending evolves over time.

    Feature Engineering:
        Spending Trend: Calculate the slope of spending on CUI_* columns over time.
        Average Order Value: Total Spending / Frequency.
        Spending Variability: Standard deviation of spending across CUI_*.

    Clustering Approach:
        Use Spending Trend, Average Order Value, and Spending Variability.
        Use algorithms like K-Means or Hierarchical Clustering.

    Profiling Clusters:
        Profile by last_order to see if spending correlates with recent activity.
        Analyze cuisine preferences (CUI_*) and promotions (last_promo).

Perspective 7: Diversity in Ordering Habits
Objective: Group customers by how diverse their ordering habits are across vendors, products, and cuisines.

    Feature Engineering:

        Product Diversity Score: Normalize product_count by Frequency.
        Cuisine Diversity Score: Count non-zero entries in CUI_*.

    Clustering Approach:
        Use Vendor Diversity Score, Product Diversity Score, and Cuisine Diversity Score.
        Apply clustering algorithms and analyze cluster cohesiveness.

    Profiling Clusters:
        Use categorical features to interpret diversity (e.g., payment_method and last_promo).
        Assess is_chain to identify if chains drive higher or lower diversity.

Perspective 8: Promotion Sensitivity Clustering
Objective: Identify clusters based on responsiveness to promotions.

    Feature Engineering:
        Promotion Usage Frequency: Count the number of orders associated with a promotion.
        Promo-to-Order Ratio: Promotion Usage Frequency / Frequency.
        Recent Promo Effectiveness: Whether last_order was associated with last_promo.

    Clustering Approach:
        Use Promotion Usage Frequency, Promo-to-Order Ratio, and Recent Promo Effectiveness.
        Normalize and apply clustering (e.g., Gaussian Mixture Models).

    Profiling Clusters:
        Use categorical variables like last_promo and customer_region to profile clusters.
        Examine CUI_* spending for promotional impact on cuisine preferences.

These perspectives provide diverse ways to analyze and segment customers, catering to different business needs such as optimizing promotions, identifying high-value customers, or tailoring regional marketing strategies. Each clustering perspective emphasizes a unique aspect of customer behavior, making them complementary for a comprehensive analysis.
